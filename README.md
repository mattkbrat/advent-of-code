# Advent of Code 2022 with Deno

This project has been bootstrapped with Fresh[^1] to complete the Advent of Code for the year 2022 using Deno[^2].

## Project Structure

The project is setup with the following structure:

- inputs: `.txt` inputs to run the day's code against

- routes: Fresh bootstrapped routes to later provide a graphical output for the day's code.

- lib: specific library files and specific constants.

- utils: test-independent utility functions.

## CLI

- Run the code with `deno task start`

- Test the code with `deno task test`
